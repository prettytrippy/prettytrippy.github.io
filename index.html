        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Tripp Dow, a rising third-year undergraduate at the University of Minnesota.
            I study computer science, with particular interests in machine learning, computational metaresearch, and medical software.<br><br>
            This fall, I'm excited to begin working with <a href="https://dykang.github.io/">Dongyeop Kang</a> and <a href="https://anmartin94.github.io/">Anna Martin-Boyle</a>, on NLP applications for academic writing.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Through the course of my studies, I've participated in various projects, related to computation, langauge, and health.</p>
            <h3>Identifying Worldwide Astrophysicists from Scientific Literature (May 2023 - Present)</h3>
            <p>
                During my time as an undergraduate research assistant at Michigan State University, 
                I joined the <a href="https://deepthought-initiative.github.io/">DeepThought Initiative</a>, to develop author name disambiguation algorithms.
                Our current approach leverages coauthorship information to train a random forest model on graphical and string-based attributes,
                and yields a low contamination rate, even with sparse training data. 
                As we continue to move forward, we will apply this model to publication data in astrophysics, 
                in order to improve peer review, connect authors, and decrease unfairness in the academic literature.
            </p>
            <h3>BreathMetrics (June 2022 - August 2022)</h3>
            <p>
                Before my sophomore year, I worked as a software engineering intern at <a href="https://www.area10labs.com/">Area 10 Labs</a>, designing an application for the analysis, capture, and storage of respiratory data.
                I used the Unity framework to develop a GUI, used methods from machine learning and signal processing to analyze time-series data, and implemented spirometer calibration algorithms from medical literature.
            </p>
            <h3>Language and Food (January 2022 - May 2022)</h3>
            <p>
                As part of the DFRACS scholarship program, I assisted a linguistics professor with her research, in the fields of conversation analysis and pragmatics.
                I transcribed audio from study recordings, and formatted the speech data according to standards created by my mentor.
                For our analysis, we focused on group imagination and modality, argumentation and evidential statements, and humor. 
            </p>
