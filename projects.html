                <h3>SayAhh Signal Processing</h3>
                <p>
                    I wrote a large amount of signal processing code for <a href="https://www.emercent.com/">Emercent Technologies'</a> SayAhh app, an application that uses sound to measure respiratory and vocal health. 
                </p>
                <p>I implemented a variety of speech processing algorithms, such as a Dart version of the <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-abstract/111/4/1917/547221/YIN-a-fundamental-frequency-estimator-for-speech?redirectedFrom=fulltext">YIN algorithm</a> for fundamental frequency estimation.
                    My algorithms were used to gather a number of other speech biomarkers, such as jitter, shimmer, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, and some other characteristics we deemed useful.
                    I also designed a data pipeline to transport this data from a mobile device to a remote server for processing and storage.

                <h3>Breather Firmware</h3>
                <p>
                    I designed a Windows application to set up medical devices on the factory floor. 
                    This executable is currently being run to download firmware, run tests, create labels, and store logs while manufacturing a new respiratory training device.

                <h3>Binaural Beats Entrainment</h3>
                <p>
                    I designed and ran an exploratory study on the use of binaural beats for brain-wave entrainment. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Entrainment happens when interacting oscillatory systems start to synchronize, as destructive interference cancels out their unlike frequency components, leaving the ones they have in common.
                    Sinces neurons fire in designated frequency bands, it's plausible that low frequency sound waves (like the ones heard in binaural beats) would be able to entrain brain waves into desirable states (relaxed, focused, etc.).
                    If I could show that this happens, we could create an application to entrain brainwaves, to assist people with sleep, focus, learning, and other cognitive tasks.
                </p>
                <p>The system I designed consisted of a wearable rig using the <a href="https://openbci.com/">OpenBCI</a> Ganglion board for EEG data collection, a software module to play binaural beats at target frequencies, and a data processing toolkit to look for evidence of entrainment.
                    Although the results were negative, I am grateful for this opportunity to conduct research in an industrial setting.
                </p>
                <!-- <p>No link for this one, but when I feel like dropping >$500 for a Ganglion, I'll probably do some hobby projects in a similar vein.</p> -->

                <h3>Calibration Server</h3>
                <p>
                    I created an internal web server for <a href="https://www.emercent.com/">Emercent Technologies</a> to store and process data from spirometers and other proprietary medical devices.
                    The server stored files in an authenticated MongoDB database.
                    I also implemented a variety of machine learning algorithms, to compare their effectiveness in calibrating spirometric equipment.
                    Algorithms included the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7118642/">Yeh algorithm</a>, a transformer model, and various regression models.
